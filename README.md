# local-llm-chatbot
made a locally running ChatBot using Falcon-7B model to chat with your pdfs.It doesnt depend on libraries that have way too much abstraction.
the Bot created this way not only ensures that your data is private but also makes sure that you control each and every aspect of the bot, including all kinds of preprocessing, top results, search, etc.
